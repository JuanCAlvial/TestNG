@Test
-prints in alphabetical order unless there are before and after conditions

import org.testng.annotations.*; <-- This star will import every interface so wont clutter code

@BeforeMethod -- executes before before all the tests and then the test will execute

@AfterMethod -- will execute after all the tests have ran.

Before and After Method will print before and after every method

@BeforeClass will run before the code

ex:
@BeforeClass

@BeforeMethod
@Test                -----1st Test
@AfterMethod

@BeforeMethod
@Test2              -----2nd Test
@AfterMethod

@AfterClassMethod
