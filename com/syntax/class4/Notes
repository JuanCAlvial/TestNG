Class 4

DataProvider -  allows to perform DDT(data driven testing)
    testing same functionality with different sets of data
    data and code are independent. If make any changes in data our code in test does not get affected

groups in TestNG - allow to group test cases:
    based on types of testing (smoke, regression, database etc.)
    based on functionality(login, search, payment etc)
    based on sprint (sprint5, sprint 6, sprint 7 etc)

Listeners is a feature that listens/tracks to any event that happened during test execution:
    test starts
    test pass
    test failed
    test skipped
    test finished

How to implement
    1. Create a Listener class that will implement ITestListener interface
    2. Provide implementation to the methods you want
    3. configure xml file by adding <listeners>
